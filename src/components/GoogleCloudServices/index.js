                <h3>What are Google Cloud Platform Managed Services?</h3>
                <div className="google-cloud-services-inner">
                    <p>Google Cloud Platform is one of the most dynamically growing cloud service providers, the core developer of Kubernetes and a large innovator. GCP provides multiple cloud services like:</p>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Infrastructure-as-a-Service,</li>
                    <li>AI and ML libraries and APIs,</li>
                    <li>Big Data analytics,</li>
                    <li>Serverless computing,</li>
                    <li>IoT tools and SDK,</li>
                    <li>Service meshes and other.</li>
                </ul>

                <div>
                    <p>Google Cloud products and services are multiple, and sorting them out on your own is quite a laborious task. This is why Nirmitee.io, a reputable DevOps-as-a-Service company, listed among top-10 Managed Services Providers worldwide is offering the Managed GCP Services to help businesses of all sizes get the most of their cloud investment with GCP. </p>
                    <h3>GCP managed services from Nirmitee.io</h3>
                    <p>If you plan to deploy your product to GCP or already manage it there, cost-efficiency becomes one of the most important parameters. Google Cloud provides a ton of exciting features or services, that can be hugely beneficial for your business — if they are correctly configured. It’s exactly what Nirmitee.io managed GCP services do — we help you build and run efficient GCP systems! </p>
                    <h3>GCP infrastructure configured and run by professionals</h3>
                    <p>There are three ways to run GCP infrastructure efficiently: do it yourself, hire GCP admins or outsource to a Managed Services Provider. In the first case, you lose time while your IT dept learns the ropes. In the second case, GCP admins cost a lot and you are served closer to the end of SLA terms. In the third case, you get skilled professionals at affordable prices. </p>
                    <h3>Latest Google Cloud features for your business</h3>
                    <p>When working with cloud service providers, you’ll want to use the best and latest stable versions of their products and services. This means constant retraining of your personnel, however. When working with IT outsourcing companies like Nirmitee.io, these R&D expenses are spread across all the customers, so you get the latest expertise at a fraction of costs of mastering it by your IT team. </p>
                    <h3>Instant access to motivated professionals</h3>
                    <p>Working on the same project for years slows down professional growth and reduces motivation. When the business outsources to a Managed Service Provider, they get access to dedicated DevOps teams that work on a multitude of projects. This way they are also interested in new challenges and are motivated to offer the most cost-efficient solutions. </p>
