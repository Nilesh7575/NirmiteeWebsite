                <h1 className="main-heading" style={{ fontSize: "22px", marginTop: "30px" }}>Problems With Data Science</h1>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>Business intelligence primarily focuses on monitoring the current state of business data, with the sole purpose of understanding the historical performance of a business.</span>
                </div>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>This interpretation of past data proves useful when analyzing the outcome of previous internal business processes, funnels, and high-level decision making.</span>
                </div>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>The issue with business intelligence, however, is that it’s limited in its approach. Any data analytics firm worth your time will be the first to point out that data science is the only way to truly use the knowledge gained from historical trends and patterns into making wise future predictions.</span>
                </div>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>This explains why business intelligence is primarily used in Descriptive Analytics, whereas Data Science can be used for Predictive or Prescriptive Analytics.</span>
                </div>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>Professional data science analysis can help you <b>make sense of the flood of information</b> you might be drowning in. It’ll help you see things that you and your colleagues might miss. It’ll help convince stakeholders that your vision is the <b>right one.</b></span>
                </div>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>The form and function of data science run together. Data science turns raw data into accurate predictions so you can make high-impact decisions that lead to competitive advantage.</span>
                </div>
                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
                    <span>And with our lives increasingly driven by endless streams of information, being able to properly leverage data science has become a <b>major priority for organizations of every size.</b></span>

                <div className="Service_container-inner" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
