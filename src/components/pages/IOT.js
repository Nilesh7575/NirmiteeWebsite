                    <span>The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. The Internet of Things or IoT refers to devices that collect and transmit data via the internet. The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention.”Things,” in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals, cameras streaming live feeds of wild animals in coastal waters, automobiles with built-in sensors, DNA analysis devices for environmental/food/pathogen monitoring, or field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations. Legal scholars suggest “things” as an “inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service”. It is becoming an increasingly growing topic of conversation both in the workplace and outside of it. Because of this growing demand in the market, there is a need for quality IoT application design and development for companies in various segments and Nirmitee.io has the right set of employees expertise and experienced in IOT.</span>
