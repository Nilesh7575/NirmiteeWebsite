        <h4>Technology in Retail
</h4>

          <span>
          According to Jim Dion, a Chicago-based retail technology consultant, high tech innovations help retailers stay competitive in four key categories: convenience, price, size and speed.

          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
          In stores and on the sales floor, high tech tools help balance inventory assortments, manage ordering and track pricing. Customer tracking tools increase customer satisfaction and promote loyalty by enhancing shoppers' in-store experience.

          </span>
<br /><br />
          <span>
          On the executive level, technology improves planning and decision making. Various data-mining software help make stocking, pricing and marketing decisions, as well as improve product design and development.

          </span>
<br /><br />

<h4>Inventory Tracking
</h4>
          <span>
          Electronic Data Interchange (EDI): Direct computer-to-computer transactions from the store to the vendors' databases and ordering systems.

          </span>
<br /><br />

    <span>
    Wireless hand-held inventory units: Take inventory and download the data to a database at headquarters.

    </span>
    <br /><br />
    
    <span>Universal Product Code (UPC): Product identification system using bar code and unique numbering 
</span>
<br /><br />


<span>Automatic replenishment: Manages restocking of what's been sold.
</span>
<br /><br />

<span>Virtual shelves: Intranets between retailers and vendors that expedite communication and on-time replenishment.
</span>
<br /><br />

<h4>Customer Service

            <div className="li-components">
            <ol type="1">
            <li> <span className="li-components-head"> Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software:</span>Allows retailers to track customers. </li>
            <li><span className="li-components-head">CD-ROMs at the register:  </span>Let sales associates make special orders on the spot. Also deliver sales training to sales associates on the floor.</li>

          </div>
          </span>

<h4>Data Warehousing</h4>


          <span>
          Executive Information Systems (EIS): Produce graphs of complex data that help retail executives make business decisions.

          </span>

          <h4>
          Become Tech Savvy

          </h4>

          <span>
          If you're in school, take courses to develop your computer literacy. Learn to use spreadsheets, databases and word-processing software. If you're already working in retail, much technology training happens on the job. Don't avoid training opportunities; jump at them. Stay abreast of events by reading trade magazines and business periodicals and attending retail trade shows.

          </span>

          <h4>Outlook
</h4>

          <span>
          Using technology does not guarantee a retailer's success; it is just one piece of the puzzle. As RIS News, a retail technology publication, points out, a retailer may use technology to manage merchandise flow, but if it stocks merchandise customers don't want, its business suffers. So learn to combine tech know-how with common sense, interpersonal skills, problem-solving savvy and enthusiasm
