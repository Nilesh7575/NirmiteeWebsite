            Over the last many years, ecommerce has changed how people buy and
            sell online. The Internet offers a quick and easy way for people to
            buy things without having to visit a real store. An online store can
            reach customers anywhere in the world. Online businesses are rapidly
            developing an ecommerce website to face times of economic adversity
            by offering greater discounts, flat-rate delivery, loyalty programs,
            and other incentives. There are many popular ecommerce platforms
            that make it easy to run promotions and keep your customers happy.
            Finally, although the boom in online sales has also opened a
            potential avenue for fraud and scams, site-builders have managed to
            stay ahead by offering top-of-the-line site protection and payment
            security to keep the online marketplace as safe as possible.

          <span>
            Building a successful ecommerce site has become one of the most
            popular business trends. It may seem like a herculean task to set up
            an online business (not underestimating it either) or the actual
            e-commerce website development, but in real it isn’t that big of a
            hurdle as you’ve probably been hearing from most of the folks out
            there.
          </span>

          <br />
          <br />

          <span>
            Doing online business means trades of goods from your Webstore to
            the customer, and trade means transactions. The idea of creating an
            online store raises few questions in everyone’s mind like ‘how’ and
            ‘who’ can build my e-commerce store? On what platforms can my
            ecommerce store be built? How can I find products to sell on my
            online store and how the transactions will be handled?
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Like all business requires proper planning, discussion, backup
            plans, contingency plan, similarly before building any e-commerce
            store, you need proper planning about everything. Before starting,
            you need to think and list down all the possible aspects
            repercussions regarding online business.
          </span>
<br /><br />
          <span>
            Write your e-business plans. The e-commerce plans start with website
            goals. Who will be your targeted audience? What kind of products and
            services you want to offer. How much time and money you need to make
            your online presence. How will you handle shipping and payments?
          </span>
<br /><br />
          <span>
            Although there are many ecommerce and website hosting platforms, you
            must choose a perfect platform where your ecommerce store can be
            built.
          </span>
<br /><br />
          <span>
            It all seems difficult at first, but with every step, you will grasp
            things easily. A lot of the things which didn’t make sense at first
            would probably start resonating with time. Here’s a rundown of
            everything which requires opening an e-commerce store. Let’s get
            down to business:
          </span>

          <h4>
            The Process of E-commerce Website Development- Let’s Get Started!
          </h4>

          <span>
            There are many ecommerce tools and technologies required to build an
            e-commerce store and operate a successful online business. Both
            software and hardware technologies must be included in your
            e-business plan.
          </span>

          <h5>Web Server</h5>

          <span>
            A web server is used to host an e-commerce website. All the Html,
            JavaScript, PHP files, databases, media files that make up the
            entire website are stored on this server. The web server runs on
            Windows or Linux operating system. Managing a web server is a very
            specific job. The website development companies host the site on
            their own web server or pay a hosting company to provide space on a
            secure web server.
          </span>

          <h5>Server Software</h5>

          <span>
            When a user visits any website on a web browser, the web server
            knows the client is requesting some specific information. So it
            processes that request and serves the correct files to the client.
            The web browser then displays these files to the user.
          </span>

          <span>
            There are many types of server software available including
            application software, database server, file server software, and
            cloud computing software. The popular web server software includes
            Apache and Windows IIS. Server software can either use on a physical
            server or on a virtual / cloud server.
          </span>

          <h5>Web Tools</h5>

          <span>
            A web authoring tool is used to create the front end of an
            e-commerce website. They range from basic HTML text editors (like
            Notepad++) to more complex graphic authoring tools and CMS (content
            management system) with built-in frameworks and debugging tools.
          </span>

          <span>
            Html files are created by Dreamweaver along with the CSS (cascading
            style sheet) which enhance the visual appearance of the site.
            Another web authoring tool would be Visual Studio .net that can be
            used to make the sites which have integrated databases in it.
            Graphic design packages are also web authoring tools which design
            the skin for a user interface.
          </span>

          <h5>Database System</h5>

          <span>
            A database is an integral part of an e-commerce website. The
            database is used to store information about the products and
            services of the website such as pricing, description, image,
            details, and sales. In addition to this, the customer details are
            also stored in the database like what they ordered, their payment
            details, shipping details, and contact information.
          </span>

          <span>
            It is necessary to program the website to connect securely to the
            database so that all the orders are processed correctly and your
            business runs smoothly. Technologies like PHP and MySQL are the
            communication route between the website and the DBMS (database
            management system).
          </span>

          <h5>Networking</h5>

          <span>
            TCP (transfer control protocol) and IP (internet protocol) defines
            as how computers should connect with each other through the internet
            and how they share information. Common TCP/IP protocols are HTTPS,
            HTTP, and FTP. We use these protocols to access the website without
            even realizing it. FTP (file transfer protocol) used to download
            files from a browser.
          </span>

          <span>
            HTTPS (where the “S” stands for security) responsible for the secure
            communication between a server and a browser like an account
            information or personal information.
          </span>

          <span>
            For an e-commerce website or online store, it is considered
            essential to provide a secure connection. SSL (secure sockets layer)
            and TLS (transport layer security) are the protocols associated with
            trust and security of any e-commerce website.
          </span>

          <h5>Browser Compatibility</h5>

          <span>
            A web browser is a software application that is used to locate,
            receive and display content received from the web servers. Popular
            web browsers include Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet
            Explorer and Safari. Web developers and Web development agencies
            test the website see how it displays on multiple browsers across
            multiple devices and screen sizes before launching the website.
          </span>

          <span>
            The Tip: To analyze website traffics, use tools like Google
            Analytics to get an idea as what browsers people are using and which
            one is the most popular.
          </span>

          <h5>Ports</h5>

          <span>
            Ports allow one device to connect with the other through a different
            and unique IP address. A device can have more than one port.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          <span>
            Port 25 (SMTP) is usually reserved for email. It is used to transmit
            data from remote email servers. If that port is blocked no emails
            can be sent. Some other common port numbers are 80(HTTP), 443
            (HTTPS), 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH). Firewalls can often block a port to
            tighten the security.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h5>Domain Names</h5>

          <span>
            Domain names link to a company or a brand. Successful e-commerce
            companies have recognizable domain names. If you have any smaller
            business then it is best to select the domain name as per your
            business name. This would help to rank highly in search engines.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            If a business becomes successful online, it is important to protect
            the brand by doing multiple registrations of domain names such as
            .com, .net, .uk, .org, .co
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Doing this ensures that no one can steal your business by copying
            your business model.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Here is a quick recap that will help you put everything into place.

          <h5>What is business development for ecommerce?</h5>

          <span>
            Business development is a relatively vague term with a purpose and
            responsibility that differs from company to company. While the
            definition has been infinitely discussed, the ultimate objective of
            business development is to find strategic opportunities that create
            long-term value.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h5>Web Technologies for E-Commerce Web Development</h5>
          <span>
            Websites and apps have become crucial for businesses and
            organizations to showcase their services, goods, and brands. To this
            end, you need a website that is well designed with feature-rich
            apps. Modern ecommerce web technologies have acquired a status where
            it’s not mandatory for businesses to develop e-commerce websites or
            apps right from scratch.
