          Audience management strategy is already a maturing space, with many marketers having connected the dots between audience selection, targeting, campaign optimization and measurement. The deluge of data to help marketers target the right people with the right message, in the right channel
and device, at the right time means that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) powered technologies will only continue to rise.

          Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) help, by sifting through huge volumes of data in real time to find patterns, predict outcomes and suggest the next best action to each individual customer in order to move them further in their buying journey. It is not just the scale and speed that AI can bring to the process of marketing that makes it so powerful – it is also the intelligence it brings that would be impossible for a human to match at that scale and speed.              </span>

          Marketers will see AI analyze customer behaviour in real-time basis multiple data points such as gender, age, location, preferences, device, platform, previous history and more. It will be able to map user data with ad viewing metrics such as when or where an ad is played, for what duration and so on, to suggest when to place an ad where and in what format. The ability of AI to identify buyer patterns accurately and then place ads accordingly, helps increase overall ad effectiveness, thereby reducing the cost of customer acquisition.

          Who doesn’t check some sort of social media platform every day? The power of social media is optimizing the logistics industry and operations as a whole. These platforms are becoming the easiest and most efficient way for companies to communicate with customers, conveying urgent information, industry news, and customer responses quickly. According to Hootsuite, 59% of Americans who have a social media account agree that customer service via social media has made it easier to get questions and concerns resolved. Here at Shapiro, we use multiple platforms to get news and updates to our customers: LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.
