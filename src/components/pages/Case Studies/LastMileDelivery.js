      <h4> <span className='bold'> Itâ€™s a fact: </span> <span className='italics'> 40-50% of the total cost of delivery occurs at the last mile!! </span>
</h4>
        <span>
        From restaurant delivery services to parcel post, logistics and operations professionals must move goods from distribution hubs to customers on time and at the lowest cost. Last mile delivery not only makes up a huge chunk of the total delivery cost, but also fundamentally affects customer loyalty.
For these reasons, retailers, on-demand delivery companies and logistics providers are hungry for new technologies and processes to evolve last-mile delivery. The goal is to deliver on time to enhance customer satisfaction, while boosting driver throughput and saving money and resources.
