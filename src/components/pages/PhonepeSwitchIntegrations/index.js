                    <h3>Launching ‘PhonePe Switch’ — Your shortcut to a world of apps</h3>

                <div className="phonepe-switch-container-inner">
                    <p>We recently announced the launch of ‘PhonePe Switch’, a one-click entry point to a world of apps on our platform. ‘PhonePe Switch’ allows customers to seamlessly switch between PhonePe and their favourite food, grocery, shopping and travel apps from within the PhonePe app itself. Users can login to these apps without downloading them, with just a single tap. PhonePe Switch also helps our partners showcase exclusive offers and discounts to our users seamlessly. A user just needs to click on any partner logo to see the best offers running at the time.</p>
                    <p>Every year, companies spend millions of dollars on app development, customer acquisition and battling high uninstall rates. PhonePe Switch enables merchant partners to integrate their existing PWAs (progressive web apps) or mobile-sites to the platform, and instantly reach out to over 60 million monthly active PhonePe app users.</p>
                    <p>PhonePe Switch emphasises our efforts to build a partner app ecosystem which offers our users a very convenient way to access and engage with multiple apps. The Switch distribution platform has grown 400% in the last 6 months, enabling faster customer acquisition for our partners. While start-ups are able to acquire high-quality users at low costs, larger partners get help in specific areas like driving non-cash payments, growing their business in select geographies.</p>
                    <p>We are also focused on bringing more partners across categories, including travel, mobility, food, hyper-local, shopping and entertainment on the platform. Partners like Ola, redBus, Goibibo, Myntra, Delhi Metro, Grofers are already a part of ‘PhonePe Switch’ and we are seeing excellent user traction as a result of such partnerships. </p>
