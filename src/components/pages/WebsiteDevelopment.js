                    <span>A software development process (also known as a software development
                        methodology, model, or life cycle) is a framework that is used to structure,
                        plan, and control the process of developing information systems. A wide variety
                        of such frameworks has evolved over the years, each with its own recognized
                        strengths and weaknesses. At nirmitee.io, we follow the Agile methodology.
                        In this methodology, every feature is tested simultaneously with the development process.
                        This makes development faster.</span>
